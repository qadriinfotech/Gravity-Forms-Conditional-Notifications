**NOTE**: Gravity Forms 1.7 comes with enhanced Notification Logic for forms which completely substites what this plugin does. Consider upgrading to GF1.7 instead of installing this plugin.

A Gravity Forms Addon that extends Notification Logic on a per-form per-field basis. Allows a form to have a custom notification sent (or suppress default notification dispatch altogether).

Upload to wp-content/plugins/, activate, enjoy.
